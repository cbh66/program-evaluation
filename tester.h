 *  tester.h                                                                 *
 *  Written By: Colin Hamilton, Tufts University                             *
 *  This file contains the interface for the Tester class, a class designed  *
 *    to compare two files.  One file is considered the "benchmark" file,    *
 *    and contains the expected output.  The other is the "comparison" file, *
 *    which contains the actual output.                                      *
 *  One need only create an object of this type, call appropriate functions  *
 *    to specify how to compare the files, and then call one of the run      *
 *    methods.  Available options include ignoring differences in whitespace *
 *    (or other characters, which can be added), ignoring too-long input,    *
 *    and ignoring too-short output.                                         *
 *                                                                           *
 *  Tester::run() simply compares the two files, returning true if they      *
 *     match according to the options set, and false otherwise.              *
 *  Tester::run_verbosely() compares the two files, but returns a more       *
 *     detailed report in the form of a string.  The string will typically   *
 *     report why the test failed - too-short input, too-long input, (unless *
 *     deactivated), or the specific line and column of the comparison file  *
 *     where the first difference was found.  It will say what was expected  *
 *     and what was recieved.  If the files matched, the empty string is     *
 *     returned, unless print_on_success was set, in which case a string     *
 *     with a success message is returned.                                   *
 *                                                                           *
 *  TO DO:                                                                   *
